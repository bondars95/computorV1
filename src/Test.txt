5 * X^0 = 5 * X^0 (all real numbers)
4 * X^0 = 8 * X^0 (no solutions)
5 * X^0 = 4 * X^0 + 7 * X^1 (solution exists)
5 * X^0 + 13 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 1 * X^1 (discriminant positive two solutions)
6 * X^0 + 11 * X^1 + 5 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 1 * X^1 (discriminant equal 0)
5 * X^0 + 3 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 0 * X^1 (two complex numbers)
5 * X^0 + 3 * X^1 + 3 * X^1 = 1 * X^0 + 0 * X^3 (forbid) ---
